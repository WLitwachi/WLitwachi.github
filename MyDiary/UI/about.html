    MyDiary is a web app where you can write your day plan, feelings and emotion.If National Park Concierge were an actual job, travel company Off the Beaten Path (OTBP) would be a leading candidate. Don't believe us? Ask the National Park Conservation Association itself, which has officially partnered with OTBP this year on their educational travel program. OTBP was started 30 years ago by Bill and Pam Ryan, who were field reporters for Condé Nast Traveler. Experience showed them that there’s a way to travel that connects you to the authentic core of a place, so they seized the moment and formed a company devoted to highly-curated travel experiences. They started in the American West, then branched out to Patagonia and other areas of the Western Hemisphere. Over the course of three decades, they’ve built an organization with global reach and a wide range of services.
